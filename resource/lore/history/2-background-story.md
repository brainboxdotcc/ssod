Seconds pass.

The Thing glides through the heavy door the guards once protected, a package cradled beneath what might pass for an arm. Seven scrolls—tattered vellum etched with runes pulsing faintly with eldritch energy. The relics exude power, and corruption.

The Thing pauses. Then, with impossible ease, it turns sharply and vanishes—passing upward, directly through the stone ceiling, scrolls and all.

Moments later, a scream tears through the void. A sound of agony, fury, and denial. The Thing is being pulled back—banished by a force it did not expect. It howls as it is ripped away, flung through the fabric of reality to a place far from here. The scrolls, once gripped tightly, slip loose and vanish into the darkness.

One by one, the seven ancient scrolls fall out of the aether, scattered across Utopia—each landing hundreds of miles apart, unseen, untouched, unknowable.

The psychic shockwave left in the creature’s wake slams through the Keep like a thunderclap. It jolts you awake. Your heart races. You don’t know what has happened—but you know you cannot stay.

By dawn, the snow begins to melt, leaving only silence and bloodstains where once the guards had stood.

A knock rattles the grand wizard’s door.

“What is it now? I told you I am not to be disturbed at this hour.”

The door creaks open. A young apprentice enters, pale and anxious.

“I’m sorry, Grandmaster… but we have a serious problem.”

The wizard narrows his eyes. “Then speak plainly. You’re a wizard, not a courtier.”

The apprentice gulps and begins recounting the night’s events—his voice shaking. The tale is unbelievable. But the evidence is not.

“Sir… it was Lord Garneth. He sent a demonic assassin. It breached the Deep Vault. It tried to steal the Seven Spells of Destruction. But something stopped it—some unknown force repelled it. The scrolls were scattered during the banishment…”

The Grandmaster goes deathly still. His face drains of colour. The Seven Spells of Destruction—once sacred, intended to forge peace—had long since been tainted. They were to be hidden forever, sealed beneath stone and guarded by wards and warriors alike.

They have been kept here for centuries, as no other stronghold wished to bear the burden of guarding them.

Garneth must have known.

He must have planned this for years.

The scrolls were no ordinary artefacts. Each held untold power—power at a terrible cost. To read even one was to offer a sliver of your soul in exchange for might. To read all seven… was unthinkable. No humanity would remain.

But Garneth had no soul to lose.

He wanted Utopia. He wanted dominion.

And now the scrolls were scattered—unguarded, vulnerable.

“They must be found!” the Grandmaster roars. “If Garneth retrieves even one… Utopia will burn. Issue a call across the realm. Ten thousand gold pieces to any soul who finds and returns a scroll. And double to the one who ends Garneth!”

The apprentice sprints from the room, heart pounding. He races to alert every adventurer he can find.

But when he throws open the door to your chambers… you are already gone.

Perhaps you sensed the storm rising. Perhaps you followed a trail in your dreams. Or perhaps you simply knew your path was about to change.

From this moment, your story begins. The future of Utopia lies in your hands.
