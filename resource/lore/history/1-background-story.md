It is a rare thing indeed for an adventurer such as yourself to be summoned to the Wizard’s Keep—especially with so little warning. Word arrived only days ago from a trusted friend within those ancient walls. They did not speak plainly, only that something was stirring—something *wrong*. Whispers of unease. Odd behaviour. Strange movements in the lower levels. They asked for help. For witnesses. For protectors.

And so, you came.

It is mid-summer, yet a fierce snowstorm claws at the land. Snow and ice churn in sweeping sheets beyond your window, descending in violent flurries from the Deathdrop Mountains far to the north, coiling around the Keep’s buttresses like the fingers of some spectral hand. The Desert of Skulls lies less than ten miles away—this should not be happening. A blizzard here is an impossibility. You blame the wizards. Who else? Letting your overactive imagination rest, you climb into bed, wearied by the journey. But sleep offers little comfort. It is uneasy, filled with flickers of shadow and whispers in your dreams.

A single chime from the bell tower breaks the night. It is midnight.

The storm has not abated. Shards of snow lash the Keep’s stonework like flecks of shattered glass. Far in the distance, a solitary figure trudges toward the gates—hunched over an oaken walking stick, his lantern little more than a dim flicker in the gale. His pace is slow, deliberate. Minutes pass before he reaches the gate.

A voice rises from the light of the gatehouse—barely audible above the howling wind.

“Stop! In the name of the Magical Protectorate, who goes there?”

The old man peers toward the source, voice cracking with age and frost.

“I beg you… shelter. Just for the night. A bed, no more.”

The gatekeeper’s reply is little more than a muffled complaint. Locks clunk open with the dull weight of obligation. The gate creaks ajar. The stranger steps inside.

Moments later, only a swirl of powdered bone and blood remains where the gatekeeper once stood—scattered like ash across the stone.

Something silent slithers down the corridor leading inward. Room by room, it searches—methodical, unseen. It passes through your chamber while you sleep, slipping through you like a cold mist. Your dreams darken. Nightmares coil around your mind. You toss and turn, unaware of the terror that shares your breath.

Far below, in the lowest levels of the Keep, the Thing descends. It follows a corridor etched with ancient runes, drawn toward a grand door of oak and gold. Two guards stand sentinel before it—seasoned mages trained to repel magical threats, alert and tense.

The Thing passes the first, still invisible, leaving only a void of dread in its wake.

“Deran? That you?” the first guard mutters, hearing something, a whisper, a breathless murmur in the gloom. But it’s already too late. A phantom pull tears his soul from his body, dragging it into the arcane void. The guard crumples without sound.

“Hey, eyes up! We’re supposed to be watch—” the second sentinel turns too late.

Where his comrade once stood now looms a Thing of shadows and despair. Vaguely humanoid, its form ripples like smoke in black water. Thousands of jagged white teeth grin from an abyssal maw, beneath two crimson eyes—vortices of hatred and hunger. The creature opens its mouth wider, and with a wet, slithering sound, a mass of iridescent tendrils lashes out.

The guard has time for a fraction of a scream before the Thing pulls him into the abyss of its mouth—devouring flesh, soul, and sanity in a torment no mortal should ever endure.
