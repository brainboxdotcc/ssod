# üßæ What is *Paragraph*?

**Paragraph** is the custom content language of *Seven Spells of Destruction*. It is a structured, tag-based format used to define every location, encounter, and narrative branch in the game.

The name **‚ÄúParagraph‚Äù** reflects its dual purpose:

- It is a **paragraph of prose**, forming the narrative foundation of each game moment.
- It is also a combination of **para** and **graph**:
  - **Para**, from Greek, means "beside", "beyond", or "adjacent to", suggesting that the logic exists alongside the prose.
  - **Graph** refers to the underlying structure of the world, a network of connected locations, conditions, and choices.

Each *Paragraph* is therefore a unit of both **narrative and logic**, blending prose with branching conditions, stat changes, and links to other parts of the world.

This design allows writers to create **reactive, conditionally branching content** without needing to write code. Developers can still extend the system using embedded JavaScript and persistent state logic.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Designed for Scale and Safety

*Paragraph* is built for:
- **Large-scale games**, with thousands of locations
- **Multiplayer-aware logic**, with support for both global and per-player state
- **Safe editing workflows**, using a real-time linter to catch mistakes
- **Hybrid prose and logic authorship**, where interactive elements are embedded directly into narrative text

It is not intended as a general-purpose programming language. Instead, it is designed for building a reactive world with **structured branching and tightly integrated story logic**.
