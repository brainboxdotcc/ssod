# Writing Style and Narrative Voice Guide

This guide outlines how to write engaging and thematically consistent prose for **The Seven Spells of Destruction**. Whether you're designing a town, writing a crypt crawl, or penning the blurb on a magical scroll, your words shape the player's experience. This guide will help you write in a way that complements the game world — tonally dark, occasionally wry, and rich in implied history.

## 🎭 Tone and Style

Seven Spells is set in a fading world — one where the past is a mystery and magic is both a tool and a threat. The tone should reflect that:

- **Grounded fantasy** — avoid flowery high-fantasy excess.
- **Bleak but not hopeless** — show the cracks, but don’t overdo the doom.
- **Occasional dark humour** — used sparingly, this adds levity without breaking immersion.
- **Implied depth** — hint at lore, don’t dump it.

> "The walls weep with moisture that isn’t water. You decide not to touch it."

> "Once, this place had a name. But it was traded for silence."

---

## 🧱 Sentence Construction

- Prefer **present tense**: _You walk into the room. A smell hits you._
- Keep paragraphs short and readable — no walls of text.
- Use **second-person** perspective: _You see... You feel..._
- Use **active voice** unless deliberately being passive.

> _Wrong:_ "A key was found by you."
>
> _Right:_ "You find a key."

---

## 🌐 Show, Don’t Tell

Let the player draw conclusions. Don’t write _"This place is spooky."_ Show it:

> "The candlelight bends, as if trying to flee the room."

Avoid listing facts. Instead, embed them in the environment or dialogue.

> _Instead of:_ "The temple was built in 233 AI and abandoned in 301."
>
> _Try:_ "Dust obscures a cracked plaque: 'Dedicated 233 AI, by the faithful. May their devotion outlive stone.'"

---

## 🎭 Characters and Dialogue

When writing NPCs:
- Give them **motivations**, not monologues.
- Use distinctive speech patterns or vocabulary.
- Let their dialogue **reveal the world** indirectly.

> "Course I know the tunnels. But knowing ain’t free. What’ve you got that bleeds?"

Avoid direct exposition. Let them be unreliable, secretive, or mistaken — just like real people.

---

## 📘 Lore Delivery

Players can read books, overhear conversations, or notice strange symbols. Spread your worldbuilding across:
- Environmental description
- Toast messages
- Passive effects
- Books and scrolls
- Optional side areas

Make lore something the player **discovers**, not something they are **given**.

---

## 💬 Toast Messages

Use `toast()` only for important flavour moments or impactful changes. Keep them short and dramatic or humorous:

> _"The mirror stares back — and it blinks."_
>
> _"Your stomach churns. You probably shouldn’t have licked that rune."_

Avoid overusing them, or they’ll lose their impact.

---

## ✨ Examples

**Bad:**
> You are in a dark room. There is a skeleton. It is scary.

**Better:**
> Something shifts in the dark. A brittle clatter, like teeth on stone.

**Bad:**
> The village is poor. They want help.

**Better:**
> The villagers eye your boots with a kind of hunger. One dares approach.

## 🔚 Final Advice

- Trust the player to connect the dots.
- Let locations feel lived-in and slightly broken.
- Ask: _Would this make someone curious?_ If yes, keep it.
- Less is often more.

This world isn’t one of heroic grandeur — it’s one of old ruins, broken pacts, and uncertain choices. Let your writing whisper that truth.
