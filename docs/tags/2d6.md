# Tag Documentation: `<2d6>` – Two Six-Sided Dice Roll

The `<2d6>` tag instructs the game engine to roll **two six-sided dice** and store the result for use in later conditional logic. This tag is used in paragraphs where a dice-based event or test is about to occur.

---

## 🧩 Syntax

```html
<2d6>
```

- No attributes or parameters are required.
- The tag must appear **before** any `<if dice ...>` checks if it is to be meaningful.

---

## 🎲 Behaviour

When `<2d6>` is encountered:

- Two six-sided dice are rolled.
- Their values are **summed** and stored in the `g_dice` value for the current player.
- If a roll has already been made (`g_dice` is already set), it is **not re-rolled**. This preserves the original result for consistent conditional logic in the same paragraph.

---

## ✅ Use With `<if dice ...>`

Once the dice have been rolled using `<2d6>`, you can conditionally branch using the result:

```html
<if dice gt 9> You rolled high! <else> Not high enough. <endif>
```

This will compare the stored 2D6 result (range 2–12) with the condition.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- You **must** call `<2d6>` before using `<if dice ...>`, otherwise the condition will fail or be ignored.
- Only one 2D6 roll is permitted per paragraph per player. Repeated calls to `<2d6>` do nothing once `g_dice` is set.

---

## 📘 Example

```html
<2d6>
<if dice lt 6>
  You barely managed to react in time!
<else>
  You react confidently, unfazed.
<endif>
```

This rolls two dice and uses the result to determine how well the player responds.
