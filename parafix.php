Summarize the context of the sentence before a link tag into short words.
Insert the summarized text into the link tag. Example: TEXT <LINK=1> is converted to TEXT <LINK=1, CONTEXT> where CONTEXT is summarized context of the sentence before LINK tag.
The context refers to an action a player can take.
Do not edit anything outside the LINK tag.
There should be NO punctuation in the CONTEXT.
Do not edit any other types of tag than LINK.
Prefer text closest to the LINK tag for building CONTEXT.
Prefer describing ACTIONS, e.g. \"head south\" instead of summaries like \"south, head\".
DO NOT OUTPUT COMMA SEPARATED LISTS for the CONTEXT.
Do not rearrange words in CONTEXT, it should still be understandable english.
Each LINK should occur only ONCE in the output, determined by the LINK number.
CONTEXT should be as short as possible. Not more than 6 words or 50 letters.
Do not enclose CONTEXT in quotes.
Display ONLY the <LINK, CONTEXT>, one per line. NO OTHER PART of the text should be replied with
Do not prefix your reply with anything. The output is to be fed into a computer program.

Text is:
